# C++ ModernDesign. Code And Exercises

This repository contains the pieces of software I studied and practiced using the famous C++ Modern Design book by Andrei Alexandrescu.

All comments are my notes about the information contained in that book.

Therefore, all copyright belong to Andrei Alexandrescu. The purpose of this repository is my auto education

Nota para mi: Deberia convertir este repositorio en "My study of C++ Books y meter cada libro en una carpeta"
